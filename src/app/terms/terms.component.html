            <p>In particular, these Terms govern the relationship between us and you in respect of our provision to you of access to, and use of, the Platform. The Platform is designed to allow users of Our Service (&ldquo;<strong>Users</strong>&rdquo;) who are looking for temporary self-employed carers (&ldquo;<strong>Care</strong>&rdquo;) for their services or on behalf of others (&ldquo;<strong>Care Providers</strong>&rdquo;) to connect with other Users looking to provide Care (&ldquo;<strong>Carers</strong>&rdquo;).

            <h1>The Tools</h1>

            <p>5.1 Once registered, you will be eligible to use the Tools. The Terms applicable to your use of the Tools will vary depending on whether you are using the Services as a Care Giver or as a Care Seeker. Please see the relevant additional terms applicable to Carers and Care Providers.</p>

            <p>5.2 Once a booking request to cover a care shift (a &ldquo;<strong>Care Assignment</strong>&rdquo;) has been made by a Care Seeker and accepted by a Care Giver, the Care Seeker and Care Giver may communicate directly or through the Platform to discuss any details for the fulfilment of the Care by the Care Giver. We shall not be a party to any agreement for the delivery of Care (the &ldquo;Care Contract&rdquo;) and the Care Giver, as a self-employed contractor, and Care Seeker (or Care User as the case may be) will contract directly between themselves. However, you agree with us that any agreement between you and another User for the provision of Care shall include the terms (or terms with identical effect) listed at clause 5.3 below (the &ldquo;Mandatory Terms&rdquo;).</p>

            <p>5.3 You agree that the Care Contract shall be deemed to include the following terms (or terms with identical effect):</p>

            <p>5.3.1 the Care Giver shall provide the Care and other reasonable services requested with reasonable care and skill;</p>

            <p>5.3.2 the Care Giver shall provide the Care and other reasonable services requested in accordance with the Shift Description (as defined at clause 1.1 of the Care Seeker Terms) (save as otherwise agreed between the Users);</p>

            <p>5.3.3 the Care Seeker shall provide a safe working environment in which the Care Giver can provide the Care and other reasonable services requested;</p>

            <p>5.3.4 neither party shall assign, sub-contract or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under the Care Contract;</p>

            <p>5.3.5 all payments for the provision of the Care shall be made through the Platform using the online payment tools and in accordance with these Terms;</p>

            <p>5.3.6 all fees and charges for the provision of the Care by the Care Giver shall be exclusive of VAT and, where applicable, VAT may be charged to the Care Seeker by the Care Giver in addition;</p>

            <p>5.3.7 the Care Contract shall be governed by English law and the parties shall submit any disputes arising from the Care Contract to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts; and</p>

            <p>5.3.8 in performing their respective obligations under the Care Contract, each party shall comply with these Terms.</p>

            <p>5.4 Consideration for the use of Our Service shall be by way of a commission (the &ldquo;<strong>Commission</strong>&rdquo;) which we shall deduct automatically from the amount or amounts paid by the Care Seeker in consideration of the Care (the &ldquo;<strong>Fee</strong>&rdquo;), using the payment tools on the Platform. The Fee shall be collected by us as agent for and on behalf of the Care Giver and shall be paid to the Care Giver in accordance with these Terms. The Commission deducted by us shall be exclusive of VAT and, where applicable, VAT will be charged by us in addition.</p>

            <p>5.5 If a Care Seeker, within a reasonable period of when Care was to be provided, states that the Care was not in fact provided we may in our absolute discretion refund the entire amount of the Fee to the Care Seeker. Users acknowledge that it is at our discretion to determine when a refund to a Care Seeker may be due.</p>

            <h1>Our Role</h1>

            <p>6.1 We are a provider of technology platform services only, the Platform. We do not provide Care nor are we responsible for managing, directing or overseeing the provision of Care provided by Carers nor the conduct of Care Providers (including, but not limited to, failure or refusal to pay for Care received). We are a disclosed agent allowing for Carers to advertise their services on the Platform.</p>

            <p>6.2 We use our reasonable endeavours to undertake checks of Carers and they will not be allowed to advertise their provision of care services on the Platform until they have satisfied such checks. However, we provide no guarantee as to character, capability or suitability of Carers. Background checks are undertaken by us or on our behalf by a specialist provider though we are not responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the checks which are undertaken.</p>

            <p>6.3 We do not undertake any background checks of Care Providers nor complete risk assessments of their home environments nor undertake any planning of the Care to be provided and we are not responsible for any injury sustained by a Care Giver in the course of providing Care to a Care Seeker.</p>

            <p>6.4 We shall not be a party to any agreement for the provision of Care by a Care Giver to a Care Seeker and any such agreement shall between the Care Giver and Care Seeker and any other third party (or third parties) as the parties may agree.</p>

            <p>6.5 Nothing contained in these Terms shall render the relationship of the Care Giver to us as that of an employee, worker, agent or partner and the Care Giver shall not hold him or herself out as such. Carers acknowledge that any Care provided by them to any Care User is provided on the basis of a direct engagement by the Care Seeker. If, notwithstanding this provision, a Care Giver becomes an employee, worker, agent or partner of ours by function of law or is otherwise deemed to be so by the relevant authorities then that Care Giver shall pay or reimburse any tax or national insurance payments due from us to the relevant authorities and shall indemnify us for any loss suffered or cost incurred as a result.</p>

            <h1>Disputes</h1>

            <p>7.1 We are not obliged to have any involvement in any dispute between Users, except as required by law. If a concern or complaint is raised with us, it is at our absolute discretion what action, if any, we decide to take. Any action we take will be in line with our Concerns, Complaints and Abuse Procedures outlined in our guidelines to Users and determined by the nature of each dispute. We reserve the right to notify an appropriate authority or regulator in order to protect the interests of our Users and you accept that this overrides any confidentiality obligations, whether express or implied, we have to you.</p>

            <h1>Ratings</h1>

            <p>3.1 Care Providers may provide ratings in respect of the quality of the Care provided by you (&ldquo;<strong>Ratings</strong>&rdquo;). Ratings may relate to a number of different aspects of the Care, such aspects to be determined by us and changed at our discretion from time to time without notification to you. Ratings shall be provided by Care Providers through the Platform where they will processed automatically to formulate a ratings score for you, which will reflect the average of all Ratings received in relation to Care provided by you.

            <p>4.4 Where it is discovered that a Care Seeker has made an overpayment to your User Account via the Platform, you agree to promptly repay the overpaid amount or amounts to the Care Seeker from your User Account.

We may at our sole discretion require you to provide us evidence that you have sufficient consent or other legal authority to act on behalf of the Care User.
